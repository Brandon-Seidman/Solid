  "description": "Solid Website The idea of Solid is to be able to call upon a buddy (independent contractor) to come do you a solid for a small fee.  Did you break your leg and need someone to switch your laundry? Post a Solid request and wait for a buddy to accept.  Users would be able to log in, view other user’s Solid’s, and post their own solid requests. Users also have the ability to become contractors which will grant them access to accept Solids.",
